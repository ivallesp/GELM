# Matlab Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository is an old drawer containing different algorithms implemented for Matlab. It contains implementations for the following algorithms.

Among the algorithms, you can find GELM (Genetic Extreme Learning Machine), which is an algorithm that I designed and proved to work better than the Extreme Learning Machine. I did it in my capston project of my bachelor degree. Check it out [here](https://www.uv.es/ivape3/memoria_pfc.pdf)!


- Extreme Learning Machine
- Genetic Extreme Learning Machine
- Support Vector Machine
- Multi Layer Perceptron
- Self Organizing Maps

Each of the implementations is located into a self-contained folder.
